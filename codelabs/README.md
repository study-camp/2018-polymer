# Codelabs and Tutorials

This is a simple index of codelabs/tutorials with functioning code. A high level description of goals and insights is provided for each. Each directory listed may, in turn, have its own README.md to provide more in-depth notes in due course. 

For simplicity, each directory is prefixed (_10_, _20_ or _30_) to identify the Polymer version that was _targeted_ for that project. If an existing project is _migrated_ to a new version, the old version will be deleted (but remain accessible in repo history).

## Projects

#### [Build an Element Tutorial](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/start/first-element/intro) / [code](20-build-an-element/icon-toggle)

Create a simple custom element (button with icon) with an associated UI behavior (pressed, unpressed) and related data binding and custom CSS properties. The example here differs from the tutorial in that it was built using the Polymer CLI scaffold as a starting point (vs. the starter code provided in the documentation)


#### [Build an App Tutorial](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/start/toolbox/set-up) / [code](20-build-an-app/my-starter-app)
