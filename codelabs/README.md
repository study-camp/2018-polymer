# Codelabs and Tutorials

This is a simple index of codelabs/tutorials with functioning code. A high level description of goals and insights is provided for each. Each directory listed may, in turn, have its own README.md to provide more in-depth notes in due course. 

For simplicity, each directory is prefixed (_10_, _20_ or _30_) to identify the Polymer version that was _targeted_ for that project. If an existing project is _migrated_ to a new version, the old version will be deleted (but remain accessible in repo history).
